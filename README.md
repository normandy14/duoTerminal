# DuoTerminal

DuoTerminal, reinforce learned words that you've learned on the Duolingo web/android/ios platform,
all from the convenience of your personal terminal

Effortlessly connect to your Duolingo account without opening a web browser, and enjoy the learning vocabulary reinforcement process!

As you are presented with each word, translate each word from your target language to English.
Or try your hand at translating from English to your target language. The choice is yours!

The words that you missed or repeating until you've completed the translation cycle.
